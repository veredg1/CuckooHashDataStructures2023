# CuckooHashDataStructures2023

This is my Semester Project for my Spring 2023 Data Structures Class (through Yeshiva University Stern College for Women). This is an O(1) implementation of a Cuckoo Hash Table.
It uses a python module called BitHash (provided by my professor)
(the test file was made to test if it works on a smaller scale)
